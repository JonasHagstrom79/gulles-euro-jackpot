# Number Series Generator

This Python project generates and prints series of numbers based on the specified criteria. It generates two types of series:
1. A series of 5 numbers between 1 and 50, sorted in ascending order.
2. A series of 2 numbers between 1 and 12, also sorted in ascending order.

Both series are printed for a given number of times, as specified by the user.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system. This project has been tested with Python 3.8, but it should work with any version of Python 3.

### Prerequisites

There are no external dependencies required to run this project, so you don't need to install anything beyond Python itself.

### Running the Program

To run the program, simply execute the `number_generator.py` script with Python. You can specify the number of series to generate as an argument to the `generate_series` function within the script.

Example of running the script from the command line:

```bash
python number_generator.py
```

This will execute the `generate_series` function with the default example, which generates and prints 3 series of numbers.

## Files in the Project

- `number_generator.py`: The main Python script that contains the logic for generating and printing the number series.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the project's dependencies. This project does not have any dependencies, so this file is left blank.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running it.
- `test_number_generator.py`: A script containing tests for the `number_generator.py` script. Use this to verify that the number generation works as expected.

## Testing

To run the tests, you can use any Python testing framework compatible with your setup. The provided `test_number_generator.py` script is a good starting point for writing your tests.
